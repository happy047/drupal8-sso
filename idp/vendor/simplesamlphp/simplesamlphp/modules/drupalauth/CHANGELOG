  Resolved security issue (defect #9 - identified by alanabarrett0).

    Expanded the use of the salted hash to ensure that an attacker cannot change the uid of the authenticated Drupal user by manipulating the value of a cookie.

    Modified files:
      drupal_module/drupalauth4ssp/drupalauth4ssp.module - concatenate uid with salt before hashing
      lib/Auth/Source/External.php - concatenate uid with salt before hashing and minor adjustments
